# DevProject

Hello, 

  This is a repository filled with projects that I have built. Ive realized that I have a decent amount of experience and need to
  use Github more to show how much work I do. I still have so much to learn and so I hope from looking at my projects you can see that.

Everything Ive ever built will NOT be on here but going forward I will do as best as I can to make things open source!
