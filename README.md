# DevProject

Hello, 

  This is a repository filled with projects that I have built. Ive realized that I have a decent amount of experience and need to
  use Github more to show how much work I do. I still have so much to learn and so I hope from looking at my projects you can see that.


- "textdetection" - is the source code for a python project i created that detects objects on my tradingview screen (tradingview is a web app hat allows you to screen, analyze and even trade most fianacial insrtuments) and then actually place trades. <br>
- "WebScraperCongress" - is the source code for my Webscraper. It pulls data from the clerk.house.gov website and organizes them into neat links for the user to do research on. <br>
- "algosite" - <br>
- "CurveFit" - <br>
